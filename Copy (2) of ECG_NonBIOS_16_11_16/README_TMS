TMS320c5515 code document
ADS1298 is 24 bit
we use 20 bits resolution.
suppose gain in PGA is set to 1, 1mV amplitude square wave(2mVpp) gives peak to peak waveform of 435(digital).
1mV --> 217.5 
((217.5)*(16)) *2.4 / ((2^23)-1) volts 
converting from 24 bits to 20 bits is done by removing 4 bits by shifting  
20 bits to 16 bits is done by typecasting (removing 4 MSB bits explicitly*)
